There are 4 different leagues in a single challenge league :
- Softcore(SC): the default league without any modifiers
- Hardcore(HC): a league with no modifies but has permanent death. Characters that die with be moved to a seperate server called Standard. 
- Solo-self Found(SSF): A league with no interactions with other players. This means there is no trading allowed and you can only use items that you have found yourself.
  - Within SSF, there is also a softcore and hardcore version.
