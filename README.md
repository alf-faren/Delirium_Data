There are 4 different leagues in a single challenge league :
- Softcore(SC): the default league without any modifiers
- Hardcore(HC): a league with no modifies but has permanent death. Characters that die with be moved to a seperate server called Standard. 
- Solo-self Found(SSF): A league with no interactions with other players. This means there is no trading allowed and you can only use items that you have found yourself.
  - Within SSF, there is also a softcore and hardcore version.

Just by a quick look, the most popular ascendancy would be the Guardian.

Now let's look at how they were spread throughout their respective leagues.

From this we can tell that Guardian is favored within the trade leagues and not the solo self found leagues.



While going through the data, it clearly depicts that the favored class of Delirium is Templar and the favored Ascendancy is Guardian.
