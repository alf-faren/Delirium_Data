![Delirium Logo](Delirium_league_logo.png)


There are 4 different leagues in a single challenge league :
- Softcore(SC): the default league without any modifiers
- Hardcore(HC): a league with no modifies but has permanent death. Characters that die with be moved to a seperate server called Standard. 
- Solo-self Found(SSF): A league with no interactions with other players. This means there is no trading allowed and you can only use items that you have found yourself.
  - Within SSF, there is also a softcore and hardcore version.

Path of Exile uses three main attributes – strength, dexterity, and intelligence – and its seven playable character classes (also called core classes) are each associated with one or more attributes. The player chooses a class for his character in the character creation screen. A newly created character starts its journey through Wraeclast at Twilight Strand. Each character class has a different starting location on the passive skill tree, starting attributes and statistics and quest rewards. Later, upon completing the Labyrinth, players can specialize their character by choosing an Ascendancy subclass. The subclasses available depend on the character class chosen.

Active skill gems and support skill gems are usually referred to as skill gems. Skill gems must be equipped in item sockets before their use. Active skill gems grant an active skill for the player to use and are further augmented by linked support skill gems. There are currently 263 different active skill gems and 170 support skill gems in the game, for a total of 433.

Skill gems are not to be confused with passive skills, which provide constant stats and are mainly earned through character levelling. To avoid confusion, some players simply refer to both types of these items as "gems".

Just by a quick look, the most popular ascendancy would be the Guardian.

Now let's look at how they were spread throughout their respective leagues.

From this we can tell that Guardian is favored within the trade leagues and not the solo self found leagues. The guardian is powerful option for being a tanky support role. This ascendancy places an emphasis on enhancing and supporting their party or allies. 

## What level do the top 2000 of each league mostly die at
